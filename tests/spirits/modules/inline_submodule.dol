// Test: Inline submodule declaration
// Expected: Should parse gen with inline mod block

pub gen Container {
    has id: UInt64
    has state: state.ContainerState
}

// Inline submodule
mod state {
    pub gen ContainerState {
        has value: string
    }
}

docs {
    Test case for inline submodule declaration.
    Submodules allow organizing tightly-coupled code within a single file.
