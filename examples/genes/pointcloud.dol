  PointCloud<F> models an unordered set of 3D points with per-point features,
  where F is the feature dimensionality (a compile-time constant). This is
  a fundamental domain for Geometric Deep Learning on 3D spatial data.

  This gen represents the PointCloud domain in the GDL three-pillar ontology,
  enabling SE(3) or E(3) equivariant neural network architectures like
  PointNet, PointNet++, DGCNN, and equivariant graph neural networks.

  Properties:
  - points: List of 3D coordinates (x, y, z) as Vec3
  - features: Flattened array of per-point features (num_points * F elements)
  - num_points: Number of points in the cloud (derived)
  - feature_dim: Feature dimensionality F (compile-time constant)
  - bounds_min/bounds_max: Axis-aligned bounding box

  Feature Alignment Constraint:
  The feature_alignment rule ensures the features array has exactly
  num_points * F elements, guaranteeing one F-dimensional feature vector
  per point. This is critical for batched operations and memory safety.

  Non-Empty Constraint:
  The non_empty rule ensures at least one point exists, preventing
  degenerate cases in centroid computation and normalization.

  Valid Bounds Constraint:
  The valid_bounds rule ensures the bounding box is well-formed
  with min <= max for all dimensions.

  Inherent Symmetry:
  PointCloud domains have inherent SE(3) or E(3) symmetry depending on
  the task. SE(3) includes rotations and translations; E(3) adds reflections.
  Additionally, point clouds have S_n permutation symmetry since points
  are unordered. Architectures must be:
  - SE(3)/E(3) equivariant for geometric consistency
  - Permutation invariant/equivariant for set processing

  Common Use Cases:
  - LiDAR scans: PointCloud<4> with (x, y, z, intensity)
  - RGB-D fusion: PointCloud<6> with (r, g, b, nx, ny, nz)
  - Molecular surfaces: PointCloud<32> with learned embeddings
  - 3D object detection: PointCloud<1> with occupancy

  - VoxelGrid<T>: Discretized 3D volume (Grid3D domain)
  - Graph<N, E>: Points with explicit edge structure
