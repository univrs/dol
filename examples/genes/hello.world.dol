gen hello.world {
  message has content
  message has sender
  message has timestamp
}

docs {
  The hello.world gen is the simplest possible DOL example. It defines
  a message entity with three essential properties: content (what the
  message says), sender (who sent it), and timestamp (when it was sent).

  This demonstrates the basic pattern:
  - gen <domain>.<name> declares a new gen
  - <entity> has <property> declares properties
  - docs explains the intent and usage
}
